\section{Problem Definition}
%talk about csps, ac3 and mrv
    This project will measure the efficiency of the CSP algorithm by measuring its performance at solving a kind of puzzle known as nonograms.  Nonograms are grid based puzzles in which the player must determine if the cells are to be filled in or left blank. Grids can be any rectangular shape but are typically found as squares (N x N) where N is a multiple of 5. Whether a cell is filled or not is determined by sequence of numbers aligned with the rows and columns of the grid. If a sequence contains a single number, the associated line will contain that number of filled squares in a row. If a sequence contains 2 or more numbers, that line contains an uninterrupted line of squares equal to each number, followed by at least one empty space between each number in the order that those numbers appear. For example, the first row of the below nonogram contains only a three, therefore the first row has three cells in a row filled in. The second line contains a one followed by a  three, therefore it gets one square filled in followed by a line of three.

    Nonograms make for great problems to be solved by AI. The board and whether any square is determined to be filled, blank (denoted with an X), or unknown(left blank) is fully observable. As the solver is acting alone it will only have a single agent. The solver determines which squares are filled or not making them deterministic. Nonograms are sequential as squares being marked filled or blank will affect the possible outcome for other squares. Lastly as nonograms have well-defined rules they can be considered known environments. 
    
    An AI-based nonogram solver can be useful as a component for computer nonogram games. It can prvoide a player answers if they get stuck or be used to dynamically create puzzles iwth valid soltuions.

    \subsection{Constraint Satisfaction Problems}
    Nonograms will be structured as Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). CSPs are made up of three components: a set of variables, $X$, set of domains for each variable, $D$, and a set of contraints that are allowable combinations of values, $C$. Applying these principles to a nonogram: each row of the puzzle will be a variable. Based on the clues for a row, every possible combination of filled and unfilled cells will be found which will then compose the domain for that row. The constraints will then be the clues for the columns; a value for a row will be valid if it can create a






\section{Previous Work}
    Manyam et al \cite{10863160} applied algorithms to solve Sudoku puzzles. As nonograms have well-defined rules like sudoku, similar studies can be conducted. Backtracking, Ant Colony Optimization(ACO) and Constraint Propagation Algorithms were implemented. They applied each of these algorithms to 9x9, 16x16 and 25 x 25 sudoku puzzles. A GUI for a sudoku game was created using the Pygame framework. The player can attempt to solve the puzzle themselves and when they get stuck, click on a button that will trigger an algorithm to solve the puzzle.

    The first algorithm that they implemented was Backtracking. The algorithm placed numbers in empty cells and upon reaching a conflict, backtracked by trying a different number in the cell. Branched that break constraints (the rules of sudoku) are pruned to increase efficiency. This is continued until either the puzzle is solved or every possibility is explored, and no solution can be found.

    ACO is implemented by simulating the behavior of ants. As cells are filled a "pheromone level" is assigned. The more likely to be valid that an entry is, the higher its pheromone level. Higher pheromone levels are more likely to be picked by future ants. Each cycle pheromone levels get updated and cells are filled accordingly until a solution is found, or all possibilities are exhausted.

    Lastly constraint propagation initialized the grid with possible values for empty cells and deletes impossible values to find cells that can be inferred with sudoku solving techniques. Invalid paths are eliminated, and the cycle repeats until the puzzle is solved.

    The results show that for girds sized 9x9 Constraint Propagation is the most efficient and for larger grids, ACO is the most efficient.

\section{Methodology}
%Expand on this
The performance of the genetic algorithm measured. The metric to measure performance will be time complexity. Due to personal familiarity and the availability of the python-constraint \cite{pycon} library, the Python programming language will be used. The program will be a command line program that will solve nonograms. Nonograms will be supplied to the program via a CSV file where each column represents horizontal and vertical clues respectively, and each row represents clues for each row and column. These will be stored as arrays.
In modeling a nonogram as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem(CSP), the cells will be the variables, the domain will be the states of filled or empty and the constraints will be the clues for the puzzle. A method will be devised to determine if constraints are being violated. The time from the start of the CSP to it returning a result will be printed. The final nonogram will also be printed. This will be run for a 5x5, 10x10, 15x15 and 25x25 nonogram.
